Episcopal
=========

Episcopal is a small PHP class with a bunch of static methods for calculating dates and calendars in the Episcopal Church USA (the American branch of the worldwide Anglican Communion). As a Western Christian tradition, many of these functions are suitable for use in other denominations as well.

I wrote this as part of a rewrite of my Church's website and figured it might be useful to others as well.

 * Calculates the dates of Easter, Advent, Palm Sunday, Maundy Thursday, Good Friday and Pentecost.
 * Calculates the Liturgical year, based on the Revised Common Lectionary and the Book of Common Prayer.
 * Produces a full Liturgical calendar.
